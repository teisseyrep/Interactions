# Interactions

Interaction information is as a model-free, non-parametric measure used for detection of interaction among predictors and gauging its strength, applicable to any types of variables. It is established that it frequently finds interactions which remain undetected by standard model-based methods.  We study a challenging problem of testing the positiveness of interaction information which allows to confirm the statistical significance of the investigated interactions. It turns out that commonly used chi-squared test detects too many spurious interactions when the dependence between the variables (e.g. between two genetic markers) is strong. To overcome this problem we consider permutation test and also propose a novel HYBRID  method that combines permutation and chi-squared tests and takes into account dependence between studied variables.
